## Case Problem Statement
SBB is focusing their energy on increaasing efficiency and puntuality and are aiming to stay stay ahead of the environmental curve with technological innovations. In doing so they focus on rail strengths, good value for money for their customers and affordability for ordering parties. Their overlying goal being an attempt to simplify and personalise their products and services for customers in order to create a simple, personal and connected future for mobility. 

This brings us to the problem. One of the roadbumps along the path to a simple future is parking. SBB wants to be able to forecast parking space availability for SBB train station parking lots in order to inform customers ahead of time if whether a parking lot will have spaces available or not. 

A side challenge, additional to the primary challenge of forecasting is to identify a few parking spots where SBB can record addictional parking data from in order to improve the forecasting model we create. 


## Our appraoch

We realised that solving for forecasting falls directly in line with SBB's vision of the future. By providing forecasts on their app for parking spots, customers can easily plan ahead of time which parking lots they want to park at, what time they need to arrive at a parking lot in order to to easily get a space, etc. This simplifies by helping customers make better informed decisions, it perosnalisez the experience for each user as they can conveniently pick from hours in advance upto days in advance to check if a parking spot might be avaialble avaiable . All of his is achieved while making their users feel more connected to SBB.

We had to make a decision early on. We decided to focus all our energy on a technical solution and not design a UI. Reason being that SBB first and foremost wants to ensure that accurate forecasts are made. Poorly made forecasts can cause customers to loose trust in a comapny. Nobody trusts a weahter channel that tells you it's going to snow in the middle of a tropical summer. While humans might never make such a blunderous error, a poorly designed forecasting model can definetely make such an error. We want to avoid extreme scenarios where SBB looses customers because the forecast mentioned that all parking spots might be full while most turned out to be actually empty and the opposite where customers are disatisfied when they arrive at an occupied parking spot when the forecst was actualy in their favor.

We also were aware that SBB already has a functioning app with a parking feature in it. Th
