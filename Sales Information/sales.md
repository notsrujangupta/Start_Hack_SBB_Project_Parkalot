To go with our plan of using meteo data, sales data, and UNIX time to get appropriate expected values for spots being used at burgdorf, we cleaned all the sales data from the files provided and found that despite there being 7000+ data points for spots used (not more than 80 concurrent) in the burgdorf parking lot, there were only 397 total tickets sold whose ending dates were within 2021. After talking to representatives in SBB, the sales data is clearly incorrect enough for its use to not be warranted within the premise of our project. So for now, we intend to ignore the sales data altogether.
